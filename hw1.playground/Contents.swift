import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: [They are not the same type because the values passed into the constructor can be nil because they are optionals and the instance variables unwrap the optional variables being passed in; and nil is not type String.]


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
    
        for i in 0..<numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true //: must return something after the **for loop**
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: [### The compiler dislikes the **for loop** because it wasn't in the right format. That's not how you initialize a **for loop**; already debugged.
//:  ### There is no return statement after the for loop. If all of the words in *words* equal the words in *reversedWords*, then the function must return true (it did not before; debugged it). Also, at the bottom arePalindromes() is called as a type/class method so there must be a class preceding the func.]


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: [### It is not the correct way to declaring a dictionary. You have to assign (=) the var(iable) countLetters instead of the colon, and you need the open and closed parenthesis at the end of the initialization.
//:  ### In the bottom, the **wordsObj** is initialized, and then the method isAnagram() is called like an instance method so isAnagram() should be an instance method, not a type/class method. Also at the end of the isAnagram() method should return true instead of nil (which is not a boolean type). ]
